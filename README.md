### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0xMartin/RoboCupMS.git
    cd RoboCupMS
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory. This file holds all necessary configurations and secrets.
    ```env
    # Database Credentials
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourSecretRootPassword
    DB_DATABASE=robocup
    DB_USER=robocup_root
    DB_PASSWORD=a63W9bXZYhcwAT9B

    # Application Port
    APP_PORT=8080

    # SSL Secrets
    KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=f4R03eRRG3
    KEY_PASSWORD=f4R03eRRG3

    # Google OAuth2 Secrets
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
    ```

3.  **Build and run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The application will be running at `https://localhost:8080`.

## Quick Test ‚úÖ

To verify the API is running, call a public endpoint using `curl`:

```bash
# The -k flag bypasses the self-signed SSL certificate check
curl -k https://localhost:8080/api/discipline/all
```
